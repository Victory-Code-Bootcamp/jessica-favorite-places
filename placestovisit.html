      <li>html was created at CERN</li>
      <li>
        within html an opening and closing element is content and sometimes
        other html elements which are called children
      </li>
      <li>
        the opening tag may have one or more attributes which customize the
        appearance or behavior of the element
      </li>
      <li>head and body elements are children of the html element</li>
      <li>
        the head element includes things that are not shown on the webpage, for
        example the title
      </li>
      <li>the title is shown on the webpage's tab</li>
      <li>meta element has no closing tag</li>
      <li>img tag is self-closing</li>
      <li>
        the alt tag is the description of an img allowing accessibility for
        screen readers and robots
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>css stands for cascade style sheet</li>
      <li>
        css makes black and white html visually appealing and more interesting
      </li>
      <li>there will never be a css4. only updates to the current language</li>
      <li>a selector (element) is used that is matched to a html document</li>
      <li>
        followed by braces to create a declaration block which include
        properties that change the appearance of the element
      </li>
      <li>each is known as a css rule</li>
      <li>multiple rules can be applied to the same element</li>
      <li>
        rules have a hierarchy. rules that are more specific will override the
        rules of their parents
      </li>
      <li>thus, the order of your css rules matter!</li>
      <li>only some styles will inherit the styles of their parent</li>
      <li>
        the browser uses cascade, specificity, and inheritance to control which
        styles are applied to an element
      </li>
      <li>
        a selector can target multiple html elements of a certain type, multiple
        related elements with a custom class, or a single element with an id
      </li>
      <li>think of each html element like a box</li>
      <li>
        the content is in the middle followed by padding, border, and a margin
      </li>
      <li>use grid and flex layouts to control how the boxes flow together</li>
      <li>css can also detect user interaction, for example, hover</li>
      <li>
        you can add logic to your code with variables, custom properties, and
        media queries which can apply styles conditionally based on the size or
        type of device
      </li>
      <li>
        css can also handle complex animation with transitions and key frames
      </li>
